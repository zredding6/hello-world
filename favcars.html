    <p>I have a love for cars. There are many categories and types of cars.
      I find some hypercars, like the Koenigsegg Agera RS, to be astonishing but
       I also find beauty in modern, everyday sedans like the Nissan Maxima.
       This page is an introduction to a few of my favorite cars.
