    <p>I have a love for cars. There are many categories and types of cars.
      I find some hypercars, like the Koenigsegg Agera RS, to be astonishing but
       I also find beauty in modern, everyday sedans like the Nissan Maxima.
       This page is an introduction to a few of my favorite cars.

        I have been <b>in love</b> with this four-door sedan from Dodge since it's humble beginning as a two-door muscle car.
        This, over any other car on the road today, is definitely my dream car.

        <span class="bigLetter">A</span>dmittedly, this typically isn't anyone's dream car.
         The Maxima, specifically the 7th generation SV, from Nissan is one of my favorite cars.
         This family sedan is attractive, sporty and spacious. The interior is clean and comfortable.
         This car is simple, affordable and fun to drive - and still catches my eye out on the road whenever I see it.
